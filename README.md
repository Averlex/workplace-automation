# Work scripts
&ensp;A set of scripts written by me. They were used personally by me so I could ease and automate my routine tasks.


## Main goals
- Regular taks automatization;
- Work process speed up.


## Additional notes
- Modules __excel_operations__ and __utils__ were designed the way which my colleagues could also use them;
- Modules __some_system__ and __workflow__ contains a set with some functionality for my personal tasks;
- Module __setting__ was designed to hide all sensitive code underneath (using config files which are not represented here).


## TODO
- [x] Additional docstrings
- [x] Settings module updates
- [x] Common excel operations (reading, writing, merging, advanced vertical lookup, etc.)
- [x] Basic regular-basis functionality
- [x] Pivots based on parsing and processing results
- [x] Additional parsing functionality for my colleagues
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] GUI?
